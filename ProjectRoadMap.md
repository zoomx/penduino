# The Road Ahead... #

Currently, this project is a university major project but is intended for use by anyone interested in building a balancing robot using an Arduino. The following is a list of milestones I see the project achieving and a, rather vague, predicted date.

|Milestone|Expected|Status|
|:--------|:-------|:-----|
|Simple IR based pitch approximation libraries|  |COMPLETE|
|Simple PID control libraries |  |COMPLETE|
|Serial tunable PID controller|  |COMPLETE|
|Wiki based robot contrustion guide |  |NOT STARTED|
|Java GUI for tuning and robot telemetry|  |COMPLETE|
|**Public admission accepted**| July 2011|NOT STARTED|
|Simple Kalman filter library for Gyro/Accel pitch approximation|  |NOT STARTED|
