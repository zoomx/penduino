#summary An outline plan of where the project will go

= The Road Ahead... =

Currently, this project is a university major project but is intended for use by anyone interested in building a balancing robot using an Arduino. The following is a list of milestones I see the project achieving and a, rather vague, predicted date.

||Milestone||Expected||Status||
||Simple IR based pitch approximation libraries|| ||COMPLETE||
||Simple PID control libraries || ||COMPLETE||
||Serial tunable PID controller|| ||IN PROGRESS||
||Wiki based robot contrustion guide || ||NOT STARTED||
||Java GUI for tuning and robot telemetry|| ||NOT STARTED||
||*Public admission accepted*|| July 2011||NOT STARTED||
||Simple Kalman filter library for Gyro/Accel pitch approximation|| ||NOT STARTED||
